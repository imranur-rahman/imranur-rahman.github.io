My research in PhD focuses on software security, particularly the attack vectors posed by vulnerable dependencies in the software supply chain. My advisor is [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/). My work involves the quantitative measurement of the costs and benefits of different dependency declaration methods to reduce the risk of n-day attacks through vulnerable dependencies. Before starting my PhD, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Samsung and led a team responsible for media capture and playback features within the Chromium engine of the Samsung Internet browser.
