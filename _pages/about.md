I am a second-year PhD student at NC State University. The main focus of my research interest is Software Supply Chain Security related problems. I am currently working with [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/) on (a) a large-scale study of traditional update metrics and our proposed update metrics of OSS packages in different ecosystem (collaboration with [Google](https://deps.dev) and [Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com)), (b) sensitive API usage by different OSS packages (alone and with dependencies) and their potential effect on security advisories or choice of a library from a set of feature-equivalent libraries. The whole goal of the second project is to give developers more visibility about what's going on in their dependencies (collaboration with [Endor Labs](https://www.endorlabs.com/)).
