I am Imranur (he/him/his), a fourth-year PhD student at North Carolina State University. I am advised by [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/). My research in PhD focuses on software security, particularly the attack vectors posed by vulnerable dependencies in the software supply chain. My work involves the quantitative measurement of the costs and benefits of different dependency declaration methods to reduce the risk of n-day attacks through vulnerable dependencies. Before starting my PhD, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Samsung and led a team responsible for media capture and playback features within the Chromium engine of the Samsung Internet browser.

I am currently looking for full time academic and industry research positions. Please let me know if you think I might be a good fit!
