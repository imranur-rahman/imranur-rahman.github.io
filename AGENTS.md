## Deadlines page preferences
- Use `<br>` line breaks when a table cell lists multiple conferences.
- Keep the "Conference Schedule" column populated with each conference's event dates and location.
- Prefer official conference/CFP pages for deadlines and schedule details.
- Use current cycle dates (and include the year in schedule entries).
- If a CFP date is not published yet, mark the deadline as `TBD` and still include the schedule if available.
- Update the "Last updated" line when the table changes.
