## Deadlines page preferences
- Use `<br>` line breaks when a table cell lists multiple conferences.
- Keep the "Conference Schedule" column populated with each conference's event dates and location.
- Place each conference in the schedule column row that matches the conference month (not the submission month).
- Prefer official conference/CFP pages for deadlines and schedule details.
- Use current cycle dates (and include the year in schedule entries).
- If a CFP date is not published yet, mark the deadline as `TBD` and still include the schedule if available.
- Update the "Last updated" line when the table changes.
- Use the paper submission deadline in the table. If there is a separate abstract deadline, append a `'` to the date.
- If a new CFP date is not available, keep the most recent known CFP date in the appropriate month.
