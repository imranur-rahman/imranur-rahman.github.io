collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-03-22-characterizing-dependency
excerpt: 'We propose two dependency update metrics: Time-Out-Of-Date (TOOD) and Post-Fix-Exposure-Time (PFET), to measure the updatedness of dependencies and updatedness of vulnerable dependencies, respectively. We did a large-scale study of our proposed update metrics in NPM, PyPI, and Cargo packages.'
